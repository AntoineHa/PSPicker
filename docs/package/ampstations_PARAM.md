  function made to output the list of stations to be ouputed for amplitude    
  calculation, this is a very simple function but quite useful as it can be used   
  a lot of times   
     
  Input:   
      mainfile: main parameter file for PSPicker (string)   
      
  Output:   
      stations_amp: stations that will be used for amplitude calculation (cellarray)   
         
  Example:   
      stations_amp=ampstations_PARAM('mainfile_Gorkha.txt')
