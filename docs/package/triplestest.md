  TRIPLESTEST - non-parameteric triples test for distributional symmetry (skewness)   
    
    H = TRIPLESTEST(X) performs the non-parametric triples test for   
    symmetry (skewness) of the null hypothesis that the data in X comes   
    from a symmetrical distribution with an unknown median. The test   
    involves the examination of subsets of three variables from X (triples)   
    to determine the likelihood that the distribution is skewed. H==0   
    indicates that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at the 5
