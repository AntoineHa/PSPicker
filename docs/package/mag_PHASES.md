  Function made to compute local magnitudes for all phases present in PUASES ,structure   
  If distance exists and amplitudes exist then it will compute magnitudes   
     
  Input:   
      PHASES: Phases structure (see init_PHASES) with amplitudes   
      station_file: STATION0.HYP type file (seisan) to get mag parameters   
         
  Output:    
      OUT_PHASES: Phases with local magnitudes
