  function made to adapt window size, so that there is no overlap of windows
  when searching for amplitudes for each phase
 
  Input:
      IN: PHASES structure
      station: List of stations or one station
      
  Output:
      OUT: PHASES structure with windows adapted
 
  Example: OUT=adapt_WIN(PHASES,'station',
