  function made to clean some phases with big residuals    
  (i.e. put a weight 4 for phases that present residuals bigger than   
      a user defined threshold)   
    
  Input:   
      IN: EVENT structure containing phases   
      rms_thres: RMS threshold to put 4 weight   
      hyp: hypocenter program path   
         
  Output:   
      OUT: EVENT structure with bad phases put to 4;
