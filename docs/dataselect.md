[dataselect](https://github.com/iris-edu/dataselect) is an IRIS code made to select and cut waveforms depending on user given paramters
Please follow dataselect's user guide to make the executables.
PSPicker will extract waveforms from a SEISCOMP Database Structure [SDS](https://www.seiscomp3.org/wiki/doc/applications/slarchive/SDS) and will output one MSEED containing all the desired channels.
The MSEED file will be read into matlab using [rdmseed.m](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28803-rdmseed-and-mkmseed--read-and-write-miniseed-files?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com)
