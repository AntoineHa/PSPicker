[dataselect](https://github.com/iris-edu/dataselect) is an IRIS code made to select and cut waveforms depending on user given paramters
Please follow dataselect's user guide to make the executables.
PSPicker will extract waveforms from SEISCOMP Database Structure (SDS) and will output one MSEED containing all the desired channels.
The MSEED file will be read into matlab using [rdmseed.m](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28803-rdmseed-and-mkmseed--read-and-write-miniseed-files?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com)
